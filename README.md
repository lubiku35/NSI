# NSI - Miniprojects

> *Author*: motoslub

The goal of the mini-projects is to create a complex IoT application.


# Mini-Project 01

> *Branch*: mini_project_01

The mini-project 01 is available in the `mini_project_01` branch is the base for the forthcoming application. In mini-project 01 the core UI structure of the project is covered along with straightforward functionality for handling predefined data (deleting, filtering by number of records). The project also includes templating inheritance, which brings easier structuring of the web interfacing. The bootstrap library was used for the page layout.

# Mini-Project 02

> *Branch*: mini_project_02

In mini-project 02, available in the `mini_project_02` branch, the application was enriched with API functionality with using AJAX on the client side and also with proper routing on the server side. 

# Mini-Project 03

> *Branch*: mini_project_03

In mini-project 03, which is available via branch `mini_project_03`, the data storage has been converted from json to sqlite database. The application was also enriched by user management (registration, login, session) both on the server and client side and by data migration to the database.

# Mini-Project 04

> *Branch*: mini_project_04

In mini-project 04 which is available from the mini-project-04 branch, the application has been enriched with communication with the IoT device Raspberry Pi Pico WH. The device contains a script written in micropython which generates data that is then collected by the listener and sent to the application via API.
