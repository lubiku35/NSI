> *Author*: motoslub

The goal of the mini-projects is to create a complex IoT application.

# Mini-Project 04

> *Branch*: mini_project_04

In mini-project 04 which is available from the `mini-project-04` branch, the application has been enriched with communication with the IoT device Raspberry Pi Pico WH. The device contains a script written in micropython which generates data that is then collected by the listener and sent to the application via API.
